The LeNet architecture is an excellent “first architecture” for Convolutional Neural Networks (especially when trained on the MNIST dataset, an image dataset for handwritten digit recognition).

LeNet is small and easy to understand — yet large enough to provide interesting results. Furthermore, the combination of LeNet + MNIST is able to run on the CPU, making it easy for beginners to take their first step in Deep Learning and Convolutional Neural Networks.

In many ways, LeNet + MNIST is the “Hello, World” equivalent of Deep Learning for image classification.

The LeNet architecture consists of the following layers:
